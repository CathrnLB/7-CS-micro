- One of the most useful thing about computers is the ability to store information and change it. 
- Computers can store different *types* of data, such as: 
  - Integers (whole numbers, like =1= ,=2=, =0=, =-500=)
  - Booleans (=True= and =False=)
  - Characters (e.g. =a=, =@=, =-=, or =?=)
  - Strings (several characters together, e.g. this sentence)
  - Real numbers (E.g. 2.5, -6.2, 3.141572)
- We'll use some variables today to make patterns on the Micro:bit display.
** Learn It
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- The display on the Micro:bit uses co-ordinates just like in maths to describe where each of its LEDs are.
- The top-left LED has an =x= position of 0, and a =y= position of 0, or we write (0, 0) as a shorthand.
- The LED to the right of that is located at =(1, 0)=. The one immediately underneath that is =(1, 1)= and so on. The bottom-right most LED is therefore located at =(4, 4)=.
[[./img/microbit.png]]
- We can turn on a single LED with this command:
#+begin_src python
display.set_pixel(x, y, howBright)
#+end_src
- We replace =x=, =y= and =howBright= with numbers to indicate which LED we want to illuminate, then a number from 0 (off) to 9 (full power) for how bright the LED should be.


- Let's make an app to make an attractive light show. We'll start with something quite simple, then slowly make it more elaborate. 
- To start with, let's just aim to make the left-most LED come on, then the next one, then the next and so on until the top row is all turned on.
- Once the full row is on, we'll clear the display and start over. There are a few ways we could do this. One way would be like this:
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Open a new Micro:Python window, delete the example code, and paste this in:
#+begin_src python
from microbit import *
howBright=9

while True:
    display.set_pixel(0, 0, howBright)
    sleep(500)
    display.set_pixel(1, 0, howBright)
    sleep(500)
    display.set_pixel(2, 0, howBright)
    sleep(500)
    display.set_pixel(3, 0, howBright)
    sleep(500)
    display.set_pixel(4, 0, howBright)
    sleep(500)
    display.clear()
#+end_src
- This is 15 lines of code in total, and would do the job we want.
- There are some issues here, though. What if we wanted to make it move faster by reducing the =sleep()= time? We'd need to change the 500 in five different places.
- What if we wanted to make it light up from right to left? We'd need to reverse all the numbers.
- What about lighting all the other rows of pixels at the same time so the whole display shows the effect? We'd need to copy and paste the chunk of code another four times, then we'd have to modify each one individually. The resulting program would be huge! 
- There's got to be a better way, and this is where variables can help.

- Delete the code from before, and replace it with these 10 lines.
#+begin_src python
from microbit import *
x=0
howBright=9
while True:
    display.set_pixel(x, 0, howBright)
    x+=1
    sleep(250)
    
    if x==5:
        display.clear()
        x=0
#+end_src
- Let's consider our code...

- *Silver:* Write a program that makes a pattern that scrolls down vertically rather than horizontally.
- *Gold:* Make your pattern fill the first two columns rather than just one.
- *Platinum:* Make your pattern fill all the columns, *AND* have the brightness increase each time a new LED is turned on. When the brightness reaches 9, it should start again at 1.
